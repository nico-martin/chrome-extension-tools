> This is a Fork of [github.com/crxjs/chrome-extension-tools/](https://github.com/crxjs/chrome-extension-tools/) that merged some fixes for Chrome v130+ where scripts are blocked due to Content Security Policy enforcement.  
> Once the original project merges the required changes I do not plan to maintain this further.
